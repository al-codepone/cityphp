        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>Here we will build a hello world web application using the cityphp web application framework. The source code for this application is in /sample_applications/helloworld/. We need three PHP files for hello world: constants.php, HelloWorldHtmlBody.php and index.php. Here is constants.php:</p>
        <pre>&lt;?php

define('CITY_PHP', '/somedir/cityphp/');
define('HELLO_WORLD_PHP', '/somedir/helloworldphp/');

?&gt;</pre>
        <p>The constants.php file is for application wide constants. You'll commonly use constants for application directory structure and database credentials but you can put any constants in here you need. The CITY_PHP constant is always required and must point to the cityphp framework directory using an absolute URI. In addition to the CITY_PHP constant, you should always define at least one application directory constant that points to the respective application directory using an absolute URI. An application directory holds all the classes and interfaces for a specific library or application. In this case the HELLO_WORLD_PHP constant points to the helloworldphp application directory.</p>
        <p>When you use cityphp, you must create at least one HTML body class. You should think of HTML body classes as your base webpage templates. The HTML body class for hello world is HelloWorldHtmlBody. Here is HelloWorldHtmlBody.php:</p>
        <pre>&lt;?php

require_once(CITY_PHP . 'IView.php');

class HelloWorldHtmlBody implements IView {
    public function draw() {
        return '&lt;body&gt;hello world&lt;/body&gt;';
    }
}

?&gt;</pre>
        <p>The HelloWorldHtmlBody.php file goes in the helloworldphp application directory. You should only define one class or interface per PHP file like in the above example. At the top of the class or interface file you should require_once() all the classes and interfaces that are explicitly used in the file. In this case we only have to require_once() the IView interface. Also note that the constants in constants.php are always available in your class and interface files without having to require_once() constants.php in the file.</p>
        <p>Now we need to create a public facing PHP script that uses the classes and outputs the hello world HTML document. We will do this using index.php:</p>
        <pre>&lt;?php

require_once('./constants.php');
require_once(CITY_PHP . 'html/HtmlDoc.php');
require_once(CITY_PHP . 'html/HtmlHead.php');
require_once(HELLO_WORLD_PHP . 'html/HelloWorldHtmlBody.php');

$tags = array('&lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;',
    '&lt;meta name="description" content=""/&gt;');

$htmlHead = new HtmlHead($tags);
$htmlBody = new HelloWorldHtmlBody();
$htmlDoc = new HtmlDoc($htmlHead, $htmlBody);
print $htmlDoc-&gt;draw();

?&gt;</pre>
        <p>The public facing PHP scripts your visitors view will typically have the above structure. First require_once() constants.php and all the class files needed for the script. After that you ultimately instantiate  HTML head and body objects and pass them to an HTML document object. Then you print the draw() method of the HTML document object. The HTML document draw() method returns the entire HTML document.</p>
        <p>This is the end of the hello world example. The remaining sections in the manual will cover all the cityphp framework concepts in more detail.</p>
