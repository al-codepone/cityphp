        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>cityphp is a PHP 5 web application framework. The framework features a template system, database system, form handler and paginator. The framework does not come with any built-in HTML, CSS, JavaScript or database tables; you must build and integrate these things using the framework. The framework has no dependencies. The framework itself is predominantly object oriented. When using the framework you write both object oriented and procedural code.</p>
        <p>You use the template system to render structured documents like HTML documents. The template system is a view hierarchy. The core idea behind the view hierarchy is that you build up your view hierarchy using object composition and then you render the complete document by calling draw() on the root view object.</p>
        <p>The database system supports most PHP RDBMS vendors including MySQL and PostgreSQL. When you use the database system you must write all the raw vendor specific SQL.</p>
        <p>The form handler validates and collects POST variables. The paginator computes the total number of pages and the current page number.</p>
