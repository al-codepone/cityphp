        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>cityphp is a PHP5 web application framework. The framework features a database system, view hierarchy, form handler and paginator. The framework does not come with any built-in HTML, CSS, JavaScript or database tables; you must build and integrate these things using the framework. The framework uses object oriented programming. The framework is less than 500 lines of code.</p>
        <p>The database system supports most PHP RDBMS vendors including MySQL and PostgreSQL. When you use the database system you must write all the raw vendor specific SQL. The database system can support multiple database vendors for each application. For example you could write a database application that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.</p>
        <p>The view hierarchy is the system you use to render structured documents like HTML documents. The core idea behind the view hierarchy is that you build up your view hierarchy using object composition and then you render the complete document by calling draw() on the root view object.</p>
        <p>The form handler validates and collects POST variables. The paginator computes the total number of pages and the current page number.</p>
